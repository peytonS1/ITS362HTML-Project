# ITS362HTML-Project
ITS 362 Project

Spring 2023

The goal of this project is for college students studying website development to build a dynamic website using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The website should have a professional appearance and provide an intuitive user experience. The website should be able to interact with a MySQL database and handle dynamic content.


Choose a topic that is interesting to you and relevant to your community. This could be a blog, e-commerce site, social network, or any other type of website. Your website should allow for a user to log in as either a normal user or an administrator. Where an administrator should have a dashboard that allows them to inspect and modify user accounts.


Use HTML to structure your website and create the content. Make sure your website is accessible and responsive.

Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website. You can use libraries like jQuery or React to simplify the process.

Use PHP to handle server-side logic and generate dynamic content. You can use a PHP framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter if you wish.

Use MySQL to store your data and create dynamic content. You can use a database management tool like phpMyAdmin to manage your database.

Ensure your website is secure by implementing measures like encryption and input validation.

Write a report documenting your website's features, design choices, and challenges you faced.

Present your website to your class and explain your design and development process.



Website Info:
Trading card site where a user can look up prices from Pokémon, Yugioh, baseball, basketball cards etc., and to compare pack prices as well. The website will ask for the user to sign up and create an account for security and will be able to save the users “favorite” card selection so if the user logs back in the card they marked as favorite will appear first.
